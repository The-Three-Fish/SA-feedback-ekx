    The buyer wrote {{player.participant.buyer_price}} ECU on the piece of paper.
    This is below the minimum acceptable price your reported of {{player.participant.wta_t1}} ECU.
    As a result you have kept the gold nugget and not sold it to the buyer.
</p>
<br>
<p>
   And it turns out that the gold is worth {{player.participant.gold_value}} ECU. You will receive this payment at the end of the experiment.
